# Week 0

*Publish Date: September 27, 2024*

*[Newsletters Source][newsletters-source]*

### Overview

This Newsletter is ported over from the Kona project, and is the first
newsletter for the *Alt Stack Team*, a team dedicated to the Rust OP Stack
at [OP Labs][op-labs].


### Updates

The implementation of the Holocene hardfork is in full-swing, and [@refcell] is well into Holocene in [`kona-derive`][kona-derive]! For a working document of the fork implementation progress, see https://github.com/anton-rs/kona/issues/556.

Kona also received a docs refresh courtesy of [@clabby] over at [anton-rs.github.io/kona][kona-book]. Weâ€™d love some feedback, specifically on the SDK section!

### Blockers

We are blocked on completing the execution layer changes within [`kona`][kona] with the [`revm`][revm] changes pending. Currently Cody Wang from Coinbase is owning these, and weâ€™ve reached out to see how we can help to keep progress moving.

We are also blocked on implementing action tests upstream in [`op-e2e`][op-e2e] until the upstream implementation has been completed. However, ours is not complete either, so this will manifest in a week or two.
