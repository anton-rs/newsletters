## Introduction

Newsletters is a collection of public status updates for the **Alt Stack Team**, a team dedicated to an alternative OP Stack at [OP Labs][op-labs] that is primarily built in Rust.

This book is updated weekly by members of [OP Labs][op-labs] as well as open source contributors.

## Provenance

This book inherits the [ferra] theme from [kona's book][kona-book].

It is loosely based on format of the [Rust RFC book], with a flat page composition. All updates are listed in the left-hand side Navbar.

## Contributing

Contributors are welcome! Please see the [contributing guide][contributing] for more information.
